            "Elephant calves weigh around 120kg at birth, are able to stand within 20 minutes of being born and can walk within 1 hour.",
            'An elephant’s trunk is a very impressive multi-tool. Besides being a long nose used for smelling, breathing and trumpeting, it is also used as a hand to grab things – it is sensitive enough to pick up a blade of grass, and strong enough to rip the branches off a tree.',
            "Female elephants remain pregnant for 2 years – the longest gestation period of all mammals.",
            "The memory of elephants is legendary, and for good reason. Of all land mammals, elephants possess the largest brains. They have the ability to recall distant watering holes, other elephants, and humans they have encountered — even after the passage of many years.",
            "Elephants have small eyes and poor eyesight, but they make up for this with their amazing sense of smell – the best in the whole animal kingdom! An elephant can smell water from up to 12 miles away.",
            "Elephants are highly sensitive and caring animals, and have been observed to express grief, compassion, altruism and play. They perform greeting ceremonies when a friend that has been away for some time returns to the group, and they sometimes ‘hug’ by wrapping their trunks together. Elephants will pay respect to the bones of their dead by gently touching the skulls and tusks with their trunks and feet.",
            "Elephants are able to recognise themselves using mirrors. Such displays of self-recognition indicates a very high level of awareness, and is something which only humans, apes, cetaceans and magpies are otherwise known to do.",
            "Elephants are able to recognise and distinguish human voices. They can tell the difference between human languages, male and female voices, friendly voices and those associated with danger."

            "Lions are the most sociable of all the big cats. They live in groups called prides, which usually consist of related females and their offspring. The typical pride consists of ten to fifteen lions, with several adult females, their cubs and up to four males. Some lion prides can be as large as 40 members!",
            "Female lions are the main hunters. While they’re out looking for food, the males guard the pride’s territory and their young.",
            "A lion’s roar can be heard up to eight kilometres away.",
            "Young lions have rosettes and spots on their sandy coats, but these generally disappear as they mature.",
            "Male lions grow impressive manes the older they get. These manes grow up to 16cm long and are a sign of dominance. The older they get, the darker their manes go.   As well as attracting females, their manes may also protect their neck and head from injuries during fights.",
            "Lions can eat up to 40kg of meat in a single meal - around a quarter of their body weight.  Their tongues have sharp-pointed rasps, called papillae, which are used to scrape meat off the bones.",
            "Lions are the only known cat species where individuals roar together - with even young cubs joining in with their mews. The calling sequence usually lasts about 40 seconds.  Prides often roar together to mark their territory.",
            'Lions communicate in different ways using sounds like roars, growls, moans, and grunts. Also, by leaving scent markings and through visual signals, such as the darkness of the mane. They also rub their heads on one another as an act of bonding and to spread the "family scent".',
            "The average lion will spend between 16 and 20 hours a day just resting or sleeping. It’s because they do not have many sweat glands so in order to conserve energy, lions will just lie about and watch the world unfold around them. They are more active at night when it is cooler although they do conduct most of their hunting activity during the day."

            "Cheetahs are the fastest land animal in the world. Due to the energy required to run at such speed, cheetahs can only maintain a chase for between 200 – 300m. If a hunt isn’t successful after 1 min, they usually stop to rest.",
            "Unlike big cats like the lion, cheetahs are unable to roar. They are closer to your domestic house cat in that they can purr, both inhaling and exhaling.",
            "Known to be typically solitary animals, females raise their cubs alone for about a year before they leave. Male cheetahs sometimes will live in a small group of brothers from the same litter.",
            "The cheetahs spots act as camouflage. The cheetah can have between 2,000 and 3,000 spots, to help it blend into surroundings when hunting or hiding from predators.",
            "Cheetah cubs have a very different coat to that of adults. The cubs have a smoky colored, long, wooly coat called a mantle. It runs down their backs and acts as a form of camouflage. It helps to conceal the cubs and their mothers assist in this by constantly seeking places to ‘hide’ them to protect the cubs from predators until they are old enough to take care of themselves.",
            "Female cheetahs will move their cubs to different hiding places every few days. Once the cubs reach 5 or 6 weeks of age, they will follow their mothers and even start eating from their kills. By the time the cubs reach one year of age, they are hunting on their own. At 15 months, they will move away from their mother and either find a mate or sometimes live in a small group.",
            "Having adapted for life in an environment where there is little water, cheetahs can go three to four days without a drop of it. That doesn’t mean that they don’t actually get any liquids at all. As it turns out, cheetahs are able to draw water from the animals they hunt, kill and eat.",
            "The Cheetah is the only big cat that is capable of turning in mid-air while sprinting.",
            "Cheetahs have been around for a very, very long time. Sumerians trained cheetahs for hunting back in 3000 BC.",
            "Cheetah cubs have a shockingly high mortality rate. One study in the 90’s the Serengeti found that 95% of cubs died before reaching adulthood. Many deaths were due to Lions, but also other predators and disease."

            "Honey Badgers are not actually badgers. They don’t even really resemble badgers. In appearance they are more like an overgrown weasel, just with a really cute tail and an adorable little face.",
            "For such a small animal honey badgers have enormous brains. They are capable of tricking their captors and escaping any man-made trap. They are one of very few non-primates known to manufacture and use tools. For example, they will roll fallen tree branches into position so they can climb to a food source. If they can’t dig under an obstacle, they will build ladders to get over it.",
            "Honey badger skin is 6 millimetres thick. That is thicker than almost all other animals. To provide some perspective, that is similar to the skin of Cape buffalo, an animal that weighs 50 times more than the honey badger.",
            "Honey badgers eat honey. That is why they need a means of placating the bees. Scientists think they hypnotise or paralyse bees with their spray, thus preventing some nasty stings.",
            "Honey badgers are omnivores. They are not too picky about their food, especially when beehives are scarce. These little predators will eat mice, birds, rotting meat, flowers, fruits, and just about anything they can get their teeth into. They even eat snakes and are impervious to their venom.",
            "Digging is the favourite honey badger pastime. They dig burrows to live in and maintain a network of underground channels to help them evade predators.",
            "According to the Guinness Book of World Records, honey badgers are the world’s most fearless creature.",
            "Honey badgers are solitary animals that spend most of the year on their own. They join up during mating season and sometimes hangout with a partner for a month before taking their own path once more.",
            "Despite their solitary nature, honey badgers do like a lot of motherly affection. There is no definitive age at which a youngster leaves home.",
            "Honey badgers are born without the ability to see. Newborns are completely hairless and can’t open their eyes. Mothers must grab their offspring and carry them around in their mouth. Even in adult life they have poor eyesight, although this is compensated for by a keen sense of smell."

            "What do alpacas eat? Their diet is mostly grass or hay. But while a horse typically eats about 15 to 20 pounds (7 to 9 kg) of hay a day (or about 2% of its body weight), a 125-pound alpaca’s daily grass consumption is only about two pounds (one kg), or about 1.5% of its body weight.",
            "And when it comes to water, they’re still minimalists. While a cow needs about 10% of its body weight in water each day, alpacas only need about 1%.",
            "Shortly after their first birthday, female alpacas are ready to become mothers. Males, however, take longer to mature and aren’t usually ready to breed until they are roughly twice as old.",
            "Female alpacas instinctively give birth between approximately 10:00 am and 2:00 pm. While that’s certainly more convenient for the people who raise alpacas, the real reason is that the new alpaca mother wants to be sure that her newborn, called a cria, has time to dry off, stand up, and suckle milk before the temperature drops."

            "Migrating mallards have been clocked flying at 55 miles per hour, slightly faster than the average waterfowl. While they usually cruise at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, they can get much higher. In 1962, a mallard was struck by a commercial airliner at 21,000 feet—a record altitude for a bird-aircraft collision at the time.",

            "One of an ostrich’s more famous characteristics, its long, thick eyelashes are actually an adaptation in response to risks associated with sandstorms. Because ostriches live in a semi-arid habitat, sand and dust storms are common and can cause damage to animals’ vision and, sometimes, respiratory systems. The ostrich’s eyelashes can help limit this damage.",

            "Like other modern birds, ostriches don’t have teeth. However, because they are omnivores, they eat everything from roots, plants, and seeds, to lizards and insects. To digest their broad diet, ostriches have to swallow grit and rocks to help break down food.",
            "Like many other animals that live in the savanna, ostriches can go several days without drinking water. Ostriches do drink from watering holes when they’re available, but they can get most of their water from the food they eat.",
            "In addition to sprinting away from threats, ostriches can use their long, strong legs to kick their predators. Unlike some animals that can kick their back legs, ostriches have to strike with a forward kick to maintain their stability. This results in a powerful impact that can cause serious injury — or even death — to humans and lions alike.",
            "Contrary to popular belief, ostriches don’t bury their heads in the sand to avoid predators. In fact, they don't bury their heads at all. The confusion stems from the ostrich’s nesting behavior, which involves digging shallow holes in the sand, rather than building nests. Because their eggs need to be rotated multiple times each day, ostriches are often observed with their heads down — so it appears that they are in the sand.",

She stays near the nest throughout the 65-day incubation period, protecting it from intruders. When the eggs are ready to hatch, the young alligators make high-pitched noises from inside their eggs. This causes their mother to start digging them out of the nest and carrying her babies down to the water in her jaws. She may protect her young for up to a year.",

The adults, however, make a quick attempt in escaping and hiding under the rocks and logs. They defend themselves by overpowering the opposite threat by raising their stance and standing straight. The adults then lower their heads and wave the long tail. They might even jump to startle the threat. Biting is also an escape mechanism for these adults, they would release the poisonous toxin from their skin.",

The animals spend the bulk of their lives underwater, steering clear of nearby Homo sapiens. However, problems can arise on dry land, where the reptiles are especially vulnerable. Females haul themselves ashore during nesting season (late spring to early summer). In these delicate months, people tend to prod and handle them, making bites inevitable.",

If you do that, there is a big chance of you hurting the turtle by injuring its vertebral column. Instead, pick it up by holding its shell edges.",

            "You can say that the common snapping turtle is a kind of a famous animal. In 2006, these types of turtles were declared as the state reptile of New York. They were chosen by the state’s elementary school children.",
            "Unlike other species of turtles, the snapping turtle can’t retreat into its shell. It’s believed that with time the snapping turtle has evolved, and nowadays, it doesn’t need to hide into the shell when danger occurs. However, even though, these animals are large and dangerous, they still feel vulnerable on land. That’s the reason why they bite. It’s a part of their defense mechanism.",
            "Snapping turtles start the mating process once a female turtle has fully matured. A female turtle lays around 30-35 eggs and hides them under sand. The eggs hatch after a period ranging between 70-90 days. A snapping turtle baby is quite an adorable sight.",
            "Snapping turtles are not very social creatures that communicate through their leg movements while facing each other. They also have a strong sense of smell, vision, or touch that helps them find and identify their prey while on land, and they can also sense vibrations in case of water."

            "When plains zebras sense a predator, they use a high-pitched sound to alert the herd. And at night, at least one member of the group stays awake to keep watch.",
            "Zebras can defend their herd and territory by kicking, biting, and pushing predators. They will engage in similar aggressive behavior when another stallion attempts to take over their herd, or to display dominance in mating. If a zebra is attacked, other zebras come to its defense and form a circle around it to ward off the predator.",

This cross between a zebra and another equine, most commonly a horse or donkey, is intended to result in the best of both species. Zebras have been largely resistant to domestication, but they are healthier and less susceptible to disease than their equine relatives. A variety of zebroids have resulted from these combinations, including zedonks, zorses, and zonies.",

            "Like a cat, the fox is most active after the sun goes down. It has vertically oriented pupils so it can see in dim light, and it hunts by stalking and pouncing on its prey. The fox also has sensitive cat-like whiskers and spines on its tongue. It walks on its toes, which accounts for its elegant, feline-like tread.",
            "Geographically, the red fox has the widest range of any of the 280 animals in the order Carnivora. While its natural habitat is a mixed landscape of scrub and woodland, its flexible diet allows it to adapt to many environments. As a result, its range is the entire Northern Hemisphere, from the Arctic Circle to North Africa to Central America to the Asiatic steppes. It's even in Australia, where it's considered an invasive species.",
            "Like a guided missile, the fox harnesses the Earth's magnetic field to hunt. Other animals, like birds, sharks, and turtles, have this “magnetic sense,” but the fox is the first one we've discovered that uses it to catch prey. According to New Scientist, the fox can see the earth's magnetic field as a “ring of shadow” on its eyes that darkens as it moves toward magnetic north. When the shadow and the sound of prey lines up, it's time to pounce.",
            "Fox pups are born blind and don't open their eyes until nine days after birth. During that time, they stay with the vixen (female) in the den while the dog (male) brings them food. They live with their parents until they're 7 months old. Vixens sometimes go to great lengths to protect their pups—once, in England, a fox pup was caught in a wire trap for two weeks but survived because its mother brought it food every day.",
            "Foxes are known to play among themselves, as well as with other animals. But play also establishes social hierarchy, and it starts very young. Animal behaviorist Sandra Alvarez-Betancourt studied thousands of hours of footage taken with an infrared camera of pup activity in the den. She discovered that the struggle for dominance starts as soon as the pups can walk. The play can be brutal—and even fatal. One in five pups never make it out of the den.",
            "Although foxes are usually wild, their relationship with people goes way back. In 2011, researchers opened a grave in a 16,500-year-old Jordan cemetery to find the remains of a man and his pet fox. This was 4000 years before the first-known human and domestic dog were buried together.",
            "A study looking at urban foxes in London revealed something surprising: They are starting to look more like domesticated dogs. Compared to their rural relatives, London foxes have shorter snouts and smaller brains. While it's unclear why this is, the strange part is that the foxes are doing this to themselves. As evolutionary biologist Kevin Parsons explained to the BBC, “This is the result of foxes that have decided to live near people, showing these traits that make them look more like domesticated animals.”",
            "You can often hear their mating calls, which is a sharp, high-pitched shrieking/screaming noise that can sound quite terrifying."

            "If you’ve ever seen a true wolf paw print, it’s enough to make the hair on your back stand on ends, as their average foot size is comparable to an adult human hand, at 4 inches wide by 5 inches long.",
            "Wolves are highly territorial animals, and generally establish territories far larger than they require to survive; in order to assure a steady supply of prey. Territory size depends largely on the amount of prey available: in areas with an abundance of prey, the territories of resident wolf packs are smaller.",
            "Wolves feed their young by carrying chewed-up food in their stomachs and throwing up, or “regurgitating”, the food for the pups when they come back to the den.",
            "Wolves have only one breeding season per year – in the winter. They have their puppies in late April or early May. They have their puppies in an underground hole, or den. There are usually four to six puppies in a litter. The puppies grow up fast and are their adult size by the end of their first winter. They are grown up by the time they are two years old.",
            "A wolf which has been driven from the pack or has left of its own accord is called a lone wolf.  It avoids contact with packs and rarely howls."

            "Common frogs are often found in damp places around garden ponds, among marshes, and in long grasses. All of these places are important for common frogs. They remain highly active most days, except when hibernating during winter.",
            "The common frog is known to live a solitary life except during the breeding season. These frogs live by themselves for the majority of their lives.",
            "Male common frogs compete for female attention by producing a choir of croaks. Common female frogs are attracted to the male who has the loudest and longest croak. This leads to a lot of noise being made by males.",
            "The common frog looks like a regular frog, as its name suggests. It has smooth, moist skin which is also sticky. It uses this sticky skin to catch its prey. They can jump to great heights due to their long back legs and webbed feet and they have colorful skin which can darken or lighten to adapt to their surroundings. Common frogs have various bands of stripes on their back legs.",
            "Male common frogs are known to make croaking noises to attract female common frogs. The air from their lungs is forced over the vocal cords in their throats to make this noise. Other than croaking during the mating season, these frogs are not known to take part in any vocal communication during the rest of the year.",
            "Baby common frogs are known as tadpoles, polliwogs, or tiny froglets. After tadpoles reach the age of around four months, they start to grow back legs and then front legs. After they have absorbed their tail, they leave the water. These tiny froglets leave the water usually in the early summer or early spring, after having taken 16 weeks to grow.",
            "Most common frogs feed on a variety of insects, including insect larvae, woodlice, spiders, worms, slugs, and snails. This species can smell worms and use this scent to locate and eat them. Baby common frogs, froglets, or tadpoles are herbivores and feed on a variety of algae along with decaying plant matter.",
            "The common frog is not known to be poisonous, unlike its cousins the poison dart frog and the golden poison frog. Common frogs and tadpoles can hence be held in hands without any worries.",

            "Male elk use their high-pitched roar, called bugling, to attract mates during their mating seasons. This loud bellowing sound is also used to advertise territories in the wintertime, and has a fundamental frequency of 2 kilohertz and higher (as a point of reference, a human child averages 0.3 kilohertz). Compared to its size, there is no vocal animal with the same abilities.",
            "Unlike some other deer species, like reindeer, only male elk have antlers. They begin growing their signature antlers in the spring, shedding them each winter. While they grow, elk antlers are covered with “velvet,” a soft layer of skin that sheds when the weather turns warm in the summer. Male elk use their antlers to compete with each other during the mating season, lowering their heads and knocking them with other males both to build strength and to win the attention of females.",
            "No matter which region they inhabitat, elk are almost always more active when it is cooler. You’re more likely to see them in the winter and fall (during the mating season), as well as early spring.",
            "Elk feed on grasses, sedges, and herbaceous flowering plants in the summer, and on woody growth such as cedar, jack pine, and red maple in the winter. Just like cows, they are ruminant animals, meaning that they regurgitate their food but continue to re-chew it to aid in digestion.",
            "Elk are very important in shaping plant communities within their own habitats through their foraging and browsing. Similarly to bison, elk have been introduced to several national wildlife refuges to help restore grass prairie ecosystems.",
            "Elk newborns are kept hidden for the first several days of their lives.7. After giving birth, female elk find a camouflaged area in thick brush or tall grass to hide their babies, who lay motionless until they are about 16 days old. Calves are also born with almost no scent to avoid attracting predators and have white spots that help camouflage them, breaking up their outline and mimicking spots of light.",
            "Elk live in large groups, also called herds, that can reach well into the hundreds and even thousands. Although herds are segregated by gender, they are matriarchal, meaning they are dominated by a single female or “cow” who runs the show.",
            "Researchers have found that elks’ anklebones make distinct cracking or popping noises when they walk. We think elk use this sound (at least in part) to tell other elk that they’re approaching them from behind.",
            "The Shawnee name for elk is wapiti, which means “white rump.” Elk are connected with love and music for many Native Americans, and a well-known tribe legend credits elk with the creation of the first flute: a boy is too shy to speak to the girl he has fallen in love with. But two elk-men visit him in a dream and give him a flute, which he masters, giving him the means to communicate his feelings to the girl through music.",
            "Strange, but true: Elk can count to 10. How do we know? Scientists have noticed that when a female elk is presented with the choice between a mate with nine antler points and 10 antler points, she’ll almost always select the bull with 10 points."
