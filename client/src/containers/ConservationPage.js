                <p> Team AGA have been part of successful wildlife recovery
                stories ranging from southern Africa’s black rhino to bearded dragons
                in the remote regions of Edinburgh since September 2021. And this, in turn, is helping to protect rich and varied ecosystems while ensuring people continue to benefit from nature.</p>

                <h2>CONSERVING OUR RAINFORESTS</h2>
                <p>We protect wildlife for many reasons. It is a source of inspiration. It nurtures a sense
                of wonder. It is integral to the balance of nature. In our work, Team AGA focus on saving
                populations of the most ecologically, economically and culturally important species in the wild.
                Ultimately, by protecting species, we save this beautiful, vulnerable and utterly
                irreplaceable planet we call home. </p>

                <p> Conserving wildlife is at heart of our mission. We focus on protecting populations of some of the world’s most ecologically, economically, and culturally important species—the survival of which are threatened by poaching, illegal trade and habitat loss. We use the best science available to link on-the-ground work with high-level policy action to create lasting solutions that benefit wild animals as well as the people that live alongside them.</p>

                <p>Our oceans sustain more life than all other regions combined. Putting the marine life at heart of our mission has been our primary goal. We focus on protecting populations of some of the world’s most ecologically, economically, and culturally important species—the survival of which are threatened by trawlers, illegal trade and habitat loss. We use the best science available to link on-the-ground work with high-level policy action to create lasting solutions that benefit our marine life as well as the people that depend on them.</p>

                <h2>REPOPULATING OUR DESERTS</h2>
                <p> We aim to double the world’s wild tiger population by 2022 (TX2). We’re working with world leaders to take action, focusing conservation efforts in key sites, raising funds to permanently protect landscapes, and supporting community-based conservation. Saving tigers is about more than restoring a single species. As a large predator, tigers play an important role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Every time we protect a tiger, we protect around 25,000 acres of forest—forests that sustain wildlife and local communities and supply people around the world with clean air, water, food, and products.</p>

                <h2> EMPOWERING THE PEOPLE TO PROTECT THE PLAINS</h2>
                <p> Over the last few decades, conservationists have come to understand just how central community involvement is to wildlife conservation success—and how important it is for communities to actively steward the natural resources around them to improve economic and social well-being. Team Aga's community-based conservation work today reflects this fundamental reality. We work across a variety of communities and customize our work based on the specific needs and interests of a given place, taking into consideration each region’s particular set of conservation assets and challenges.</p>

                <h2> CLOSING ASIA'S IVORY MARKETS</h2>
                <p> Illegal killing of elephants for ivory decimates global populations. Estimates indicate that each year poachers slaughter close to 20,000 elephants, mostly for their tusks. Fueling this rampant poaching is a steady consumer demand for ivory. Overall, we see demand increasing in East Asian and Southeast Asian markets, with the greatest demand in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand. We are working to shut down the illegal markets in Thailand, and helped end the legal ivory trade in China. By tackling these markets now as part of a pan-Asian approach, We aim to leverage China’s recent actions to ban the ivory trade to prevent further displacement of the current China ivory trade to nearby countries.</p>
